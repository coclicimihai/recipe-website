    <div>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>150g> quinoa</li>
          <li>200g cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
          <li>30g sun-dried tomatoes, chopped</li>
          <li>30g pitted Kalamata olives, chopped</li>
          <li>19g chopped parsley</li>
          <li>10g chopped mint</li>
          <li>2 garlic cloves, grated</li>
          <li>2 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
          <li>200g breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p>In a pot add the quinoa and water to cover the quinoa with 1 or 2cm and cook 
            it until soft and there is no water left, (be careful not to become to watery 
            or soggy) if it is cooked and you think it is a bit to wet just cover the pot 
            with cling film and leave it for few minutes.
            I will recommend to buy the chickpeas already cooke as a tin because it will make 
            your life way more easy than cooking yourself the chickpeas but if you love that 
            then soak the chickpeas over night in water and next day put them to boil until soft,
            if you got the tin chickpeas reserve the water (as if you cooked your own chickpeas 
            reserve some of the water), drain the chickpeas and rinse them and after place them in 
            a blender and crush them, don't turn them into a paste, you want bits inside your 
            croquettes. Prepare the rest of the ingredients and place everything into a bowl and mix,but 
            use just half of the breadcrumbs.
            After take the mix and place it into a KitchenAid and using the pallet start mixing and 
            while you mix add some of the reserved chickpeas water until becomes a bit wet and 
            starts to stick so you can roll the mix into shape.
            Now that the mix is ready you need to shape the croquettes, i will recommend to 
            make them around 30 to 35g as it will be easy to cook and will be a 2 bite food, then 
            roll it trough the rest of the breadcrumb that you got left and deep fry them at 170C until nice 
            and golden brown.
